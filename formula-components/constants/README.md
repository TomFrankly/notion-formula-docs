# Constants

Constants are fixed-value mathematical or Boolean objects that can be used in Notion formulas.

Notion provides four constants:

| Constant          | Value             | Example               |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| [e](e.md)         | `2.71828`         | `e ^ (.3 * 10)`       |
| [pi](pi.md)       | `3.1415926559`    | `pi * 10`             |
| [true](true.md)   | `true` (Boolean)  | `true ? "ðŸ˜€" : "ðŸ˜­"`  |
| [false](false.md) | `false` (Boolean) | `false ? "ðŸ˜€" : "ðŸ˜­"` |
