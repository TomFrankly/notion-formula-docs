# Formula Reference Introduction

This site is a **comprehensive** reference for creating, using, and debugging [Notion formulas](https://www.notion.so/help/formulas).

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Simple Notion Formula.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Since Notion launched, it has lacked a full reference for the formulas feature. This is that reference.&#x20;

It is the result of more than 300 hours of writing, testing, debugging, and documenting (in addition to experience gained from five years of daily Notion use).&#x20;

_Every_ formula [constant](formula-components/constants/), [operator](formula-components/operators/), and [function](formula-components/functions/) has been fully documented with example code and one or more working example databases, complete with **templates** you can duplicate.

You'll also find reference guides on things like [operator precedence](reference/operator-precedence-and-associativity.md), [data type conversion](reference/converting-data-types.md), [debugging](reference/fixing-notion-formula-errors.md), and [regular expressions](reference/regular-expressions-in-notion-formulas.md).

If you'd like a more structured, hands-on way to learn Notion formulas, you can check out my Notion Formula Bootcamp course. It's a guided, exercise-heavy learning experience, and is a great companion to this site (which is more like a technical reference):

#### "Why isn't this guide written directly in Notion?"

I initially wrote most of this reference in Notion, but ultimately decided to host it on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) for multiple reasons:

* GitBook provides a left-hand, scrollable page list, which is common in the world of language/API/software documentation and extremely useful.
* It also provides a floating, right-hand table of contents for each page.
* Notion pages don't support custom domains, nor easy-to-remember URLs.
* In my testing, I found GitBook to be faster than Notion-powered documentation/website tools like [Super](https://super.so/).

For all of these reasons, the **documentation** is hosted here on Gitbook. However, I've also included a companion resource to this guide directly on Notion:

{% embed url="https://thomasfrank.notion.site/Notion-Formula-Examples-73522b3eae3843b9a225f7133505eec8" %}

This collection contains every example formula featured in this guide, along with a working example database showing the formula in action.

Additionally, each example page is able to be **duplicated,** so you can duplicate any example, test it out, and make changes in order to build custom formulas and improve your formula knowledge!
